## 1.4 One-Line Pitch

`Turn mid-air gestures into living digital art—where your hand becomes the brush and space itself the canvas.`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea

**Response:**  
An air-drawing system built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and a webcam that enables users to create digital artwork through mid-air hand gestures. The system captures and tracks hand movements in real time, translating them into precise strokes on a virtual canvas, effectively transforming the user’s hand into a contactless drawing tool. This creates an intuitive, immersive, and visually engaging interaction model that reimagines traditional input methods.

The project leverages computer vision techniques using OpenCV and hand-tracking frameworks such as MediaPipe to detect and interpret finger positions and motion. These inputs are processed on-device to render dynamic drawings, with support for gesture-based controls like color selection and brush modulation, demonstrating a modern approach to human–computer interaction.

## 2.2 Original Twist

What makes your project original?

**Response:**  
What makes this project stand out is that it goes beyond basic gesture control and focuses on creativity. Instead of just using gestures to trigger actions, it lets users freely draw in the air, making the interaction feel more natural and expressive. Features like gesture-based color and brush control also remove the need for any physical input.
Another key aspect is that it runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 4, which adds a practical challenge and makes the system more efficient. Overall, it’s a simple idea but implemented in a way that feels interactive, modern, and actually useful, using tools like OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## 7.2 Wiring Plan

Describe the main electrical connections.

**sample Response:**  
`The RASPI is connected to the motor driver (L298N) using four GPIO pins (18,19; 22,23) to control motor direction (IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4). Two PWM-capable pins (ENA and ENB; 25 and 26) are connected to control the speed of each motor.

The motors are connected to the output terminals of the motor driver. The motor driver is powered directly by the battery pack (higher voltage), while the ESP32 receives regulated 5V from the buck converter.

All components share a common ground to ensure stable operation. The projector and camera are connected to the laptop, which handles tracking and game logic separately.`

## 8.2 Software Logic/Algorithm

Describe what the code must do.

Include:

- startup behavior,
- input handling,
- sensor reading,
- decision logic,
- output behavior,
- communication logic,
- reset behavior.

**Response:**  
`

- **Sample Startup behavior:**  
  The Raspi/FPGA initializes motor pins, PWM control, and starts a WiFi access point with a web server. The laptop initializes camera input, tracking system, and projection mapping.
- **Input handling:**  
  Movement commands are received from the laptop (pygame sends http requests)
- **Sensor reading:**  
  The camera continuously captures frames, and OpenCV detects ArUco markers to determine the car’s position and orientation.
- **Decision logic:**  
  The system maps the car’s position into a virtual coordinate system and checks for nearby obstacles or collisions. If movement is valid, the command is allowed; if not, it is blocked or replaced with a feedback action (like a slight shake).
- **Output behavior:**  
  The ESP32 drives the motors using PWM signals to control speed and direction. The projector displays the updated game environment, including obstacles, targets, and feedback visuals.
- **Communication logic:**  
  The laptop sends HTTP requests (e.g., `/forward`, `/left`) to the ESP32 over WiFi. The ESP32 parses these commands and executes motor actions.
- **Reset behavior:**  
  If no command is received within a short timeout, the ESP32 stops the motors. The game resets when a level is completed or restarted.`

## 8.3 Code Flowchart

Insert a flowchart showing your code logic.

Suggested sequence:

- start,

- wait for input,

- decision,
- trigger output,
- repeat or reset,
- error handling.

## 9.2 Material Justification

Explain why you selected your main materials and components.

**Response:**  
`DC motors (BO motors) were chosen instead of servos or steppers because the system requires continuous rotation for movement rather than precise angular control (Previously, we were considering using steppers as we were planning on tracking movement on the ESP using its relative position from an origin, but since we're using a camera now, this is not required). A motor driver (L298N) was used to allow bidirectional control and speed variation using PWM.`

`The fabrication process involved designing, manufacturing, assembling, and refining both the physical structure and electronic integration of the system.`

`Design (CAD Modeling):
The initial model was created using CAD software, where components were designed based on the actual dimensions of the electronic parts. This ensured accurate fitting and minimized errors during assembly.
Cutting (Laser Cutting):
The designed parts were fabricated using laser cutting techniques. Sheets were cut precisely according to the CAD model to create the structural base and mounts for components.`

`Components were fixed using adhesives and mechanical supports. Certain parts were intentionally kept modular (not permanently fixed) to allow easy replacement and modification of electronics.
Surface Finishing:
Some parts were sanded to smooth rough edges after cutting. Sawdust mixed with adhesive was used to fill gaps and uneven edges, improving structural finish. The final structure was then painted for better aesthetics and durability.`

`Environment Setup (Dark Room Fabrication):
To enhance projection visibility, a controlled dark environment was created using Z-boards, paper sheets, and bedsheets. This minimized external light interference and improved projection clarity.
Revisions and Iterations:
Multiple adjustments were made throughout the process, including refining alignment, improving structural stability, repositioning components, and optimizing the interaction between the physical car and projected environment.`
